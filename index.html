            I am Brandon Cook, and this is my ePortfolio. During my work on the artifacts contained within this ePortfolio, I further honed and expanded my knowledge of testing, security, problem-solving, and design. I have taken a bare-bones "What If" investment calculator and expanded upon the functionality with innovative techniques, security focus, and database integration, setting a framework for a financial portfolio application. Additionally, I have redesigned a binary search tree algorithm to be self-balancing, leading to more efficient and optimized searches.

            In the code review video listed below, I demonstrate my understanding of programming functionality and the importance of manual review; it promotes team development by ensuring all members of a project understand the existing functionality, new requirements, and goals of a project. Additionally, I exhibit effective techniques for explaining these changes to stakeholders. In my artifact work, I exhibit my skills in software engineering and design, data structures and algorithms, and database integration, with a focus on security.

            In the first section, "Software Engineering & Databases," I explain the changes and functionality of my Financial Investment application, a console tool for calculating year-over-year returns given an initial investment, monthly deposit, annual interest, and number of years. The first enhancement covers expanding on the functionality for persistent storage and unit testing, with a focus on security. The second enhancement, databases, incorporated a MySQL database with connections to register a user account with a hashed password for logging in to store financial investments. This program can easily be adapted into a financial portfolio to store investment information for later review.

            In the second section, "Data Algorithms," I go over a different application that takes a list of courses and pre-requisites, sorting it into a binary search tree. I improved the algorithm to be self-balancing, limiting the maximum number of searches required to find a specific course, improving efficiency. The code review of these two artifacts before the enhancements, followed by the work that I have done to improve both programs showcase my knowledge of programming and computer science practices.
